    <h1>Workshop - 4: Visual Elements & Graphics</h1>
    <p>Save a copy of this file and modify it to be a valid HTML file.</p>
    <h2>1. Create a basic HTML structure for your file.</h2>
    <p>The basic HTML structure has been created. It consists of head and body sections. In the head section we have defined the title for the page and a CSS file to use. The body section includes paragraphs, headings and images. This is a workshop where we learn to add images and define whitespace into our page. You don't have to have the same styling but you can try to make it appealing to your eye on your own way. Try and keep in mind readability, maintainability and re-usability.</p>
    <h2>2. Add some content to your page (headings, paragraphs, links).</h2>
    <p>Here are some paragraps with text, h1 element is the main heading and all the tasks are h2 headers</p>
    <h2>3. Add an external CSS file for your page.</h2>
    <p>CSS is named ws4 and located in the css directory. The base for this file are the styles defined in the previous workshop. Some new styles are added as well.</p>
    <h2>4. Add a picture with img tag.</h2>
    <p>Here I'm adding an image with the img tag. Image is named seamk_logo and it's located in the img directory.</p>
    <img src="img/seamk_logo.jpg" alt="SeAMK logo" />
    <h2>5. Add a link to your picture.</h2>
    <p>Here is the SeAMK logo above with a link to SeAMK's website.</p>
    <a href="http://www.seamk.fi" target="_blank"><img src="img/seamk_logo.jpg" alt="SeAMK logo" /></a>
    <h2>6. Add another picture with a caption (using figure element).</h2>
    <p>In this section I'm adding the same picture with the figure element and a caption.</p>
    <figure>
      <img src="img/seamk_logo.jpg" alt="SeAMK logo" />
	     <figcaption>SeAMK logo</figcaption>
     </figure>
    <h2>7. Add a horizontal ruler on your page.</h2>
    <p>Here I have some text and after this text, I'll add a horizontal ruler.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Then I'll add yet some text.</p>
    <h2>8. Add borders to some elements on your page.</h2>
    <p class="bordered">This paragraph element will have borders. Borders are defined in the CSS file. I have added a class attribute "bordered" for this paragraph element to make it easy to style this in CSS.</p>
    <h2>9. Define appropriate whitespace (margins, padding) on elements.</h2>
    <p class="bordered whitespace">The box above doesn't look too nice without whitespace so here I've added some whitespace. This paragraph element has now two classes; <em>bordered</em> and <strong>whitespace</strong>.</p>
    <h2>10. Validate your HTML and CSS, fix if need be.</h2>
    <p>You can also add remote images like this:</p>
    <p>
        <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/check/referer" target="_blank">
            <img style="border:0;width:88px;height:31px"
                src="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/images/vcss"
                alt="Valid CSS!" />
        </a>
    </p>
    <p>Pretty similar to using a local file</p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank">
            <img style="border:0;width:88px;height:31px"
                src="img/valid_html.png"
                alt="Valid HTML!" />
        </a>
    </p>
    <h2>11. Publish your page.</h2>
